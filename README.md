The CaesarCipher project is a part of my ongoing effort to deepen my understanding of Java and algorithmic thinking. It reflects my skills in implementing classic encryption techniques in a modern programming environment. Feel free to dive into the code, explore, and connect with me for any insights or discussions!

## Description
The CaesarCipher Application is a simple yet powerful Java-based program that demonstrates the implementation of the Caesar Cipher, an ancient technique for encrypting text. The project showcases my ability to apply fundamental Java concepts to create a functional and interactive application.

Users can encrypt or decrypt messages using a specified shift, experiencing firsthand how one of the oldest encryption techniques works.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the Java files from the repository.
2. Compile and run the CaesarCipherApp.java file.
3. Upon execution, the user will be prompted to:
	- Encrypt a message.
	- Decrypt a message. 
	- Exit the application.
4. Enter the desired text and specify the shift amount as instructed.

## Technologies Used
- The program uses Java's `java.util.Scanner` class for user input.
- Java 1.8
- Eclipse IDE
- JUnit 5

## Lessons Learned
- Encryption Algorithms: Understanding and implementing the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Java.
- String Manipulation: Handling strings and character operations to apply the cipher.
- Test-Driven Development: Using JUnit to write tests that guide the development process.
- Modular Programming: Structuring code into methods and classes for readability and reuse.
- User Interaction: Creating a console-based interface for user inputs and outputs.


## Usage Examples
- Encrypting a Message
Input: "hello world", Shift: 3
Output: "khoor zruog"

- Decrypting a Message
Input: "khoor zruog", Shift: 3
Output: "hello world"
